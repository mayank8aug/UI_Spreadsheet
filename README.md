# UI_Spreadsheet

- Running the spreadsheet.html file will present you a spreadsheet of size 4x4 with read-only cells along with the row and column headers.
- Clicking on any cell will make it editable and clicking anywhere else will make it back to read-only.
- Tabbing within the cell will use the out of the box browser support to navigate the other cells.
- Right click on any cell will open a context menu with position options to insert/remove rows and columns to/from the spreadsheet.
- Clicking on the column headers will sort the spreadsheet data based on that field’s value in the ascending order. Clicking again will sort it in descending order.
- Right click on the row headers will open a context menu to cut/copy/paste rows.
- There is a button ‘Export CSV’, clicking on this will download a csv file containing the spreadsheet data.
